When a junior developer asks you a question, you have 3 options :

1. Ignore it (Rarely appropriate) ❌

Never do it.

- If you are in a time-critical situation, briefly explain that you cannot help right now but will be available to address it later.

2. Answer it

- definitely better than ignoring the question.
- suitable for time-sensitive issues or concepts far beyond their current ability.

Remember,

A junior developer won't learn how to find solutions on their own if they are constantly given the answer.

So don't make it a habit.

3. Explain it (The ideal) ✅

- break down the problem
- guide their learning, don't just give solutions. (Explain the "why")

Encourage them to explore more on their own.
